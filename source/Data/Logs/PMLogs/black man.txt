[26/04/2016]-[15:28:32 PM]: [131.247.244.138]: hey, you asked how dr increases work, right?  
[26/04/2016]-[15:29:06 PM]: [131.247.244.138]: alright, so in my experience, it's been a subtraction from the normal dr  
[26/04/2016]-[15:29:33 PM]: [131.247.244.138]: so if you've got a 26% increase at lootbox. your dr is 1:474 for instance  
[26/04/2016]-[15:29:56 PM]: [131.247.244.138]: no problem, dude 
[26/04/2016]-[15:30:18 PM]: [131.247.244.138]: and who knows, maybe it's coded differently on here, but goldenscape had  
[26/04/2016]-[15:30:24 PM]: [131.247.244.138]: it that way, so i'd get it's the same

[27/04/2016]-[12:04:59 PM]: [131.247.244.138]: seth had me clean the forums last night. 
[27/04/2016]-[12:05:25 PM]: [131.247.244.138]: well. he was planning to start completely fresh  
[27/04/2016]-[12:05:40 PM]: [131.247.244.138]: and then things got fixed by the devs 
[27/04/2016]-[12:05:47 PM]: [131.247.244.138]: no problem, bud 
[27/04/2016]-[12:06:32 PM]: [131.247.244.138]: let harryl do his thing :p  he knows what he's doing  
[27/04/2016]-[12:07:17 PM]: [131.247.244.138]: we don't have an auto donate feature even set yet  
[27/04/2016]-[12:07:40 PM]: [131.247.244.138]: exactly 
[27/04/2016]-[12:07:52 PM]: [131.247.244.138]: or he accidentally auto donated to goldenscape 
[27/04/2016]-[12:08:11 PM]: [131.247.244.138]: because i think the server is still linked via donations to goldenscape... 
[27/04/2016]-[12:08:53 PM]: [131.247.244.138]: yeah. so harryl is probably having that guy refund his donation lol  
[27/04/2016]-[13:55:18 PM]: [131.247.244.138]: can you give me the in-game rank that cooresponds to head of staff?

[28/04/2016]-[12:36:14 PM]: [131.247.244.138]: in all fairness, vanz shouldn't be that way either lol 
[28/04/2016]-[12:37:07 PM]: [131.247.244.138]: he confronted me saying "im still a helper" 
[28/04/2016]-[12:37:18 PM]: [131.247.244.138]: vanz did 
[28/04/2016]-[12:39:12 PM]: [131.247.244.138]: yep.  at 22 with a wife and regular job 
[28/04/2016]-[12:39:25 PM]: [131.247.244.138]: my god.  like, i would completely drop gaming at that point  
[28/04/2016]-[12:39:38 PM]: [131.247.244.138]: life would be perfect

[28/04/2016]-[20:01:41 PM]: [131.247.226.137]: greedyzone removed???  
[28/04/2016]-[20:01:54 PM]: [131.247.226.137]: oh nvm 
[29/04/2016]-[10:17:32 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: yes? 
[29/04/2016]-[10:19:51 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: it's pretty decent. #9 i was hoping for a better response. 
[29/04/2016]-[10:20:03 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: responsibilities of staff are important to be known  
[29/04/2016]-[10:20:34 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: well.  i'd prefer to see a little more effort on the application  
[29/04/2016]-[10:20:49 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: i also would like to watch how you interact with players 
[29/04/2016]-[10:21:04 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: since i don't have the best idea yet as to how you do 
[29/04/2016]-[10:22:09 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: okay. i believe you. it's just that you need to be more thorough with your  
[29/04/2016]-[10:22:11 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: answers 
[29/04/2016]-[10:23:21 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: i believe you like i said.  we're not taking many more staff members for now  
[29/04/2016]-[10:23:31 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: so the applicant for helper must really stand out 
[29/04/2016]-[10:29:35 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: look, i see your point, but i am not looking desperately for staff members  
[29/04/2016]-[10:33:14 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: yes, but i am looking for the best applicant i can get.  
[29/04/2016]-[10:33:25 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: i am not saying you would never be that 
[29/04/2016]-[10:33:42 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: i am saying i am not yet convinced.   
[29/04/2016]-[10:34:02 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: any gear from ::torvazone is better than cloud 
[29/04/2016]-[10:34:35 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: that's not necessarily true 
[29/04/2016]-[10:34:51 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: if you stepped up and showed you can do it   
[29/04/2016]-[10:34:58 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: either with a better application  
[29/04/2016]-[10:37:19 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: helping people is one thing, but i have had people on prior staff teams from 
[29/04/2016]-[10:37:22 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: other servers 
[29/04/2016]-[10:37:38 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: they will become staff, and then quit. or they become staff  
[29/04/2016]-[10:37:46 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: and they begin showing who they truly are  
[29/04/2016]-[10:37:54 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: i don't even know you well so far 
[29/04/2016]-[10:38:20 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: i don't promote people who seem like good ideas 
[29/04/2016]-[10:38:27 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: i promote people who are good ideas.  
[29/04/2016]-[10:38:38 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: i am giving you and anyone a chance  
[29/04/2016]-[10:38:46 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: i never said i would never accept you 
[29/04/2016]-[10:38:52 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: ... 
[29/04/2016]-[10:45:59 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: i need to see more from you.  i don't give staff positions out to anyone 
[29/04/2016]-[10:46:11 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: i am not like rsps alex.  i will be picky. 
[29/04/2016]-[10:47:10 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: look, i am from a very successful customs server. was staff there 6+  
[29/04/2016]-[10:47:12 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: months  
[29/04/2016]-[10:47:34 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: i applied for staff a week or so ago. and then rsps alex got demoted  
[29/04/2016]-[10:47:40 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: i was promoted to his spot. 
[29/04/2016]-[10:48:38 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: seth and i have been on servers together for a little bit  
[29/04/2016]-[10:48:43 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: he knew me well enough  
[29/04/2016]-[10:48:59 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: i did apply 
[29/04/2016]-[10:49:08 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: i literally said i applied  
[29/04/2016]-[10:51:58 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: i had been helping him as much as i could 
[29/04/2016]-[11:01:33 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: this fucker 
[29/04/2016]-[11:01:56 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: "ask harryl he tell you i was staff on his server"  
[29/04/2016]-[11:04:28 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: okay. we called him out good  
[29/04/2016]-[11:05:49 AM]: [131.247.226.138]: curveball question incoming
