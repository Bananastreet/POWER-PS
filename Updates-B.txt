Fixed interface scrolling for the client.
Started working on adding resizable and fullscreen, properly.

3/1/2018:
Changed the structure of the client to make it more in "compliance."
Added some getters and some other methods to make the code "cleaner" and to change it from accessing it non-statically.
Formatted the code in some classes for better readability.
Basically nothing too productive today.
